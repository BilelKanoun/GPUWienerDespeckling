# GPUWienerDespeckling
A new developed frequency domain-based approach properly designed in GPU presented as an Enhancement of the classical Wiener Filter that takes into account the local characteristics of the image. This technique is able to probvide effective results within a very limited processing time as described in Fast GPU-Based Algorithm For Despeckling SAR Data filter
